It is basically a layer on top of the official plugin SDK that provides an ability for plugins to call server's  native functions and react on various events (callbacks) just like Pawn scripts do.\r\n\r\n[Donate](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=T8B6KQ4XFAJLC)\r\n","name":"sampgdk","google":"UA-37092469-1","tagline":"Writing SA-MP game modes in C/C++","note":"Don't delete this file!

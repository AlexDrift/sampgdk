UnlimitedFS allows you to run an unlimited amount of filterscripts and 
plugins. It loads filterscripts and plugins from specified via the
"filterscripts2" and "plugins2" server.cfg options. However it doesn't handle
RCON commands like loadfs and friends (I'm thinking of adding loadfs2, etc),
so there's a room for improvement.
